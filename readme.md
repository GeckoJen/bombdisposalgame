#Bomb Disposal Game
A fun and simple game to test your logic skills under pressure!
##Description
I designed this game to practise writing an interactive website using Javascript.
The different elements of the bomb are randomly generated each time you click start, and then you simply follow the Venn diagram instructions to determine which wires need to be cut. Clicking on each wire "cuts" it - i.e. makes it disappear.
The game will time how long it takes you to disarm the bomb, how many successes vs failures you have in a session, and notes the high score (i.e. the shortest time) you've achieved in that session.
